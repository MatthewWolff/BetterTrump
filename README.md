# BetterTrump Bot
Trump tweets a lot. It's repetitive and often non-sensicalâ€”perfect for a Markov model!  
**NOTE: this bot uses a Markov chain package. If you'd like to see my hand-implemented version, see** [MarkovTweets](https://github.com/MatthewWolff/MarkovTweets).  

## Requirements:
* Python 3
* Tweepy API credentials
* Markovify package

### Where'd the tweets come from?
While Trump tweets a lot, he often deletes things, too. Someone came up with the idea of [archiving all of his tweets and making them easily downloadable](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com). Using a JSON file downloaded from there on January 3rd, 2019, I wrote `prepare_corpus.py` to comb through and remove fodder (links to websites and manual retweets) and combine all the tweets into a corpus. A small `TwitterBot` class I wrote was then used host a markov model created by [jsvine's markovify package](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify).   

### Twitter API credentials
In order to use the bot, you must have your own credentials from 
[Twitter's developer site](https://dev.twitter.com) and place them in a file called 
`keys.py` as a dictionary object called key. Additionally, you'll need the `tweepy` module. 
See below for that.

```python
key = {
    "consumer_secret": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz",
    "access_token_secret": "1234567890",
    "consumer_key": "Nequeporroquisquamestquidolorem",
    "access_token": "ipsumquiadolorsitamet"
}
```

### Installing `markovify` and `tweepy`
```bash
$ pip install markovify tweepy
```

### To run, clone the repo and execute the following:
```bash
$ python run_bot.py
```

## tweet\_as
Although twitter limits the number of tweets you can scrape to 3200, you can emulate someone's tweets off of that!  
Use `tweet_as` to select any (public) twitter user and create some tweets from them!

```
$ tweet_as realdonaldtrump
generating markov model for realdonaldtrump with up to 3200 tweets!
